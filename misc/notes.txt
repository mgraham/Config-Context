Developer's notes on the various Config modules that work (or might be
made to work) with Conig::Context

  - file inclusion
    - Config::General: supported
    - Config::Scoped:  supported
    - Config::Natural: supported

    - Config::YAML
      - no inclusion mechanism

    - XML::SAX
      - use XInclude to include files and record their urls

  - caching
    - Config::General
      - no built-in caching
      - files() provided in 1.2.8

    - Config::Scoped
      - built-in caching
      - can get at files via map { Cwd::abs_path($_) } $config_scoped->{'local'}{'includes'}
      - write author about adding interface to $config_scoped->{'local'}{'includes'}

    - XML::Simple
      - built-in caching

    - Config::Natural
      - no built-in caching
      - can't get list of files that have been read

    - Config::YAML
      - no built-in caching

  - lower case names (not supported)
    - Config::General - supported
    - Config::Scoped  - supported
    - XML::Simple     - not supported - driver would use _hash_with_lc_keys
    - Config::Natural - not supported - driver would use _hash_with_lc_keys
    - Config::YAML    - not supported - driver would use _hash_with_lc_keys

  - Generated Hash Compatibility
    - Config::Natural doesn't work (creates lists)

 - Config::Natural - needed features
   - lowercase names
   - files and no recursion

 - future:
    -CacheRequestConfig => [qw/secure address port path path_info module/],
